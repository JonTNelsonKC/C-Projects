Program 2
8 Up Solitaire Game:

Using the Deck code given for Homework1 with the shuffle algorithm that you wrote. (if your shuffle code does not work I will approve using the original shuffle.).

Write a program that will play the solitaire game 8 up described in lab on 09/30/21 (8 cards facing up in working stacks, cover cards on stacks when you have 2 cards that match by rank, see if you can use the whole deck)

Your program will list the 8 cards that are on the top of the stacks in each round of play. 

If you run out of plays the program will tell the user they lost that round and how many cards you dealt that round.

At that point your program will reset the deck, shuffle, print the shuffled deck and start dealing again. Keep a of counter of how many shuffles have been done.

When a winning hand has been dealt you should tell how many shuffles it took to get to the winning hand. 

Then prompt the user if they want to play another round.

turn in the main driver of the program as 8up<your name>.cpp and deck<your name>.cpp  and deck<your name>.h have your driver include deck<your name>.h You should not need to modify item_type or unsorted files.
